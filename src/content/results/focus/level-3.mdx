## Focus â€“ Level 3

You can focus well in the right environment but may find it difficult to tune out distractions or reengage after interruptions.

**Common experiences:**
- Losing track of thoughts mid-task
- Needing extra effort to start or finish projects
- Mental fatigue after multitasking or switching tasks often

**Suggested supports:**
- Use focused time blocks with breaks
- Eliminate small distractions during work (e.g., phones)
- Practice task-switching techniques intentionally
