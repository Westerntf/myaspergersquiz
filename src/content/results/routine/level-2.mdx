## Routine – Level 2

You have a light preference for structure but handle disruptions with little issue. Planning is helpful, but not a necessity.

**Common experiences:**
- Preferring a general outline, but open to change
- Adjusting to spontaneous events with ease
- Using routines for convenience, not comfort

**Suggested supports:**
- Continue flexible planning strategies
- Use to-do lists as helpful—not rigid—guides
- Stay open to collaborative scheduling
