## Social – Level 6

Social interaction may feel overwhelming or inaccessible. You may find it hard to follow conversations, especially in unstructured or fast-paced environments.

**Common experiences:**
- Difficulty interpreting facial expressions or gestures
- Feeling disconnected or “out of sync” with peers
- Preferring text-based or asynchronous communication

**Suggested supports:**
- One-on-one coaching or therapy
- Practicing social rehearsal in safe environments
- Using visual supports or assistive tools
