## Social – Level 3

You may find certain social dynamics confusing or draining. While you can navigate conversations, they might require more effort and leave you mentally tired.

**Common experiences:**

- Worrying about “saying the wrong thing”
- Relying on others to initiate or guide social interaction

**Suggested supports:**
- Use social story templates or planning tools
