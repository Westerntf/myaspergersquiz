## Social â€“ Level 2

You tend to feel mostly comfortable in social settings but may occasionally misread tone or intentions. Conversations feel natural, though moments of uncertainty may arise.

**Common experiences:**
- Occasional confusion over sarcasm or ambiguous language
- Feeling confident in known environments but hesitant with new people
- Needing more time to warm up socially

**Suggested supports:**
- Practice with open-ended conversation prompts
- Observe social cues in unfamiliar settings
- Join peer support or discussion groups
