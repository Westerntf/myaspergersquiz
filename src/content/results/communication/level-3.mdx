## Communication â€“ Level 3

You can express yourself but may find some forms of communication tiring or awkward, especially under pressure or in unfamiliar settings.

**Common experiences:**
- Struggling with small talk or spontaneous topics
- Needing extra time to formulate responses
- Feeling more fluent in writing than in speech

**Suggested supports:**
- Use communication scripts or outlines for social settings
- Allow pauses or visual supports in conversation
- Practice with safe conversation partners
