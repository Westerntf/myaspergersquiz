## Communication â€“ Level 5

Communication challenges often lead to anxiety or withdrawal. Expressing thoughts may feel slow or incomplete, even when ideas are clear in your mind.

**Common experiences:**
- Long pauses or hesitations in speech
- Trouble keeping pace in back-and-forth conversation
- Avoiding situations that require spontaneous communication

**Suggested supports:**
- Use AAC (alternative communication tools) if helpful
- Prepare scripts or sentence starters
- Build confidence with affirming listeners
