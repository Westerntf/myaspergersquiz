## Sensory â€“ Level 6

You often experience strong discomfort in sensory-rich environments. Even small triggers can feel intense and lead to shutdowns or anxiety.

**Common experiences:**
- Physical pain or intense anxiety from sound, light, or textures
- Avoidance of restaurants, malls, or group spaces
- Sensory overload resulting in meltdowns or withdrawal

**Suggested supports:**
- Occupational therapy for sensory processing support
- Use noise-canceling devices and tinted lenses
- Build routines that minimize sensory surprises
