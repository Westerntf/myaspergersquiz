## Sensory â€“ Level 8

You may experience extreme sensitivity to a wide range of sensory inputs. Even subtle changes in sound, light, or touch can be distressing or debilitating.

**Common experiences:**
- Inability to tolerate typical public environments
- Strong avoidance of sensory triggers at all costs
- Experiencing shutdowns or physical distress from stimuli

**Suggested supports:**
- Custom home environment for full sensory control
- Therapy focused on regulation, not exposure
- Advocate for accommodations in all settings (home, work, school)
