## Sensory â€“ Level 7

Your sensory experience is heightened to the point where daily life must be carefully structured around managing stimuli.

**Common experiences:**
- Intense discomfort with ambient noise, bright light, or scent
- Strong preference for routine and predictability in environment
- Exhaustion from constant sensory management

**Suggested supports:**
- Work with professionals on sensory diet strategies
- Create structured safe zones for decompression
- Use assistive tech (e.g., ambient noise apps, LED dimmers)
