## Sensory â€“ Level 3

You may notice increased awareness of certain sensory inputs. Some textures, sounds, or lights might distract or bother you, especially during stress.

**Common experiences:**
- Needing breaks from overstimulating spaces
- Irritation with certain clothing materials or background noise
- Feeling drained in environments with a lot of activity

**Suggested supports:**
- Use sensory aids (earplugs, sunglasses, fidget tools)
- Create low-sensory recovery spaces at home or work
- Practice grounding techniques after overload
