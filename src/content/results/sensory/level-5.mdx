## Sensory â€“ Level 5

Sensory sensitivities impact daily life and may cause frequent overstimulation. You may avoid certain environments altogether.

**Common experiences:**
- Sensory overload from crowds, noise, or lighting
- Difficulty filtering background stimuli (buzzing, ticking, etc.)
- Needing recovery time after exposure

**Suggested supports:**
- Stick to familiar, controlled environments when possible
- Customize your space for comfort (e.g., blackout curtains)
- Use apps or planners to avoid overload triggers
