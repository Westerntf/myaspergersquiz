  // Social indicators
  1: 
    "Difficulty reading facial expressions or body language often indicates challenges with intuitive social interpretation. \n     Many people rely on subtle nonverbal cues to gauge how others feel—when those signals aren’t clear, it can lead to misunderstandings. \n     If this resonates, consider practicing with mirror exercises or asking trusted friends to provide direct feedback on your expressions.",

  2: 
    "Intense anxiety in social situations without clear expectations suggests a need for explicit social structure. \n     Feeling safe and confident often comes from knowing exactly what to expect—when scripts or boundaries aren’t defined, it can trigger stress. \n     You might try creating a mental checklist before events (e.g., who will be there, topic of conversation) or role-playing scenarios with someone you trust.",

  4: 
    "Missing sarcasm or idioms and interpreting them literally reflects differences in pragmatic language comprehension. \n     Sarcasm relies on tone and context rather than literal meaning, so it can easily be misunderstood. \n     If you find this challenging, you could ask clarifying questions (“Did you mean that seriously?”) or practice common idioms in everyday conversation to build familiarity.",

  // Sensory indicators
  9: 
    "Panic responses to sudden loud noises point to auditory hyperreactivity, a core sensory trait. \n     What might be a minor startle for someone else becomes an overwhelming experience. \n     Consider wearing noise-cancelling headphones in unpredictable environments or carrying earplugs, and gradually desensitize by listening to recordings of moderate noise at a comfortable volume.",

  11: 
    "Physical pain from bright or flickering lights is a sign of visual sensory sensitivity at a higher intensity. \n     Fluorescent and LED lights often flicker imperceptibly, causing discomfort or headaches. \n     You may find relief by using tinted lenses or adjusting monitor brightness, and taking regular breaks in lower-light areas when possible.",

  12: 
    "Needing to leave a room due to strong smells shows olfactory hyperreactivity, common in autistic sensory profiles. \n     Some scents trigger nausea or distress, making it hard to remain. \n     If strong odors affect you, try carrying a small neutral-scented item (like unscented lotion) or stepping outside briefly to reset your senses.",

  // Routine indicators
  17: 
    "Severe distress from minor schedule changes reveals a high need for predictability and routine. \n     For some, even a ten-minute deviation is overwhelming and can trigger anxiety. \n     You might feel more comfortable by building in buffer time for unexpected delays or visualizing alternative plans in advance so you’re prepared for small changes.",

  21: 
    "Extreme upset at last-minute plan changes signals rigidity in daily structure and transitions. \n     When plans shift suddenly, it can feel as if your stability is gone. \n     Strategies like advance warnings (e.g., asking people to give 24-hour notice) or maintaining a “safe space” routine at the end of each day can help you cope when the unexpected happens.",

  // Communication indicators
  25: 
    "Relying on scripts because spontaneous speech is too challenging highlights pragmatic language differences. \n     Drafting exact sentences in advance can provide comfort, but it may feel exhausting in real-time. \n     Practicing open-ended questions and simple greetings with a friend can gradually build confidence, and having bullet-point notes rather than full scripts can balance structure with flexibility.",

  26: 
    "Frequent, long pauses mid-sentence show difficulty organizing thoughts in real-time conversation. \n     When the mind tries to translate thoughts into words moment-to-moment, it can feel like a roadblock. \n     Techniques such as briefly jotting a keyword or taking a deep breath before responding can help you gather your ideas without freezing.",

  // Focus indicators
  33: 
    "Losing track of time for six+ hours to the point of forgetting basic needs indicates intense hyperfocus. \n     Becoming deeply absorbed can be rewarding, but it can also drain physical and mental reserves if you forget to eat or rest. \n     Setting gentle timers or alarms, and scheduling short breaks in advance, can preserve both your focus and well-being.",

  34: 
    "Inability to switch tasks and getting stuck on one activity highlights executive-function challenges. \n     While deep engagement can feel satisfying, it may hinder completing other important tasks. \n     A visual timer or a checklist with clear step-by-step transitions can guide you to pause and reorient when it’s time to move on.",

  37: 
    "Ignoring eating or sleeping when absorbed in an activity shows a persistent hyperfocus pattern. \n     Neglecting basic needs can cause exhaustion or health issues over time. \n     You could put sticky notes near your workspace reminding you to take breaks, or have a family member text you meal reminders at set intervals.",

  39: 
    "Extreme frustration when interrupted and difficulty resuming tasks reflects difficulty with cognitive shifting. \n     Interruptions can feel like being yanked out of flow, making it hard to start again. \n     You might try using a ‘pause ritual’—for example, write down exactly where you are in the task or record a quick voice note—so you can rejoin the activity more smoothly later.",

  40: 
    "Neglecting responsibilities for days due to hyperfocus signals a strong, sustained interest fixation. \n     While passion for a project can be rewarding, it’s important to maintain balance. \n     You could use colored calendar alerts to remind you of non-negotiable obligations (bills, appointments), ensuring you step away periodically and address them.",
